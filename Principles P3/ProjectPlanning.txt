
Issues and solutions

The application had been unable to receive inputted values of the user and compare them with the correct values set for the sudoku board
- This issue was resolved as team members discussed ways on how an input can be stored as a specific id, as the id of the board value matched
  the corresponding correct value a successfully completed board was computed

Another issue had been that the database had not been adequately setup for consumers to become members of the application, without becoming a member 
a visitor is unable to access the application	
-This issue was resolved by creating a system that allows new members to join and registered members to log in.

The board application was not able to generate multiple games, it had produced many errors as the code had not been able to visually present itself
- As a group we discussed that, due to the time we had remaining, to implement only one working sudoku puzzle


The switching between websites had not be implemented with a flow as we had tested to navigate to different locations in the application numerous times
- Group members deeply understood the significance in navigating through the interface of the application, by providing comments simultaneously in the code,
  we knew where to transition each page making the interface simple and understandable

The Sudoku board could not display when using for loops in javascript to create the table
- The issue was resolved using html to create the table instead
